<h1>Grep-Lite</h1>

## What is this?
This is a lite rust version of grep. Most of this is code stolen from Rust_In_Action book. <br/>
Mostly it just a learning mechanism for myself.<br/>

## Usage
If you have rust installed already, clone the repo.<br/>
```
cargo run <pattern to match> <input file>
```
There is a demo input file 'dune.md' in the repo. It's is just a few lines from Dune by Frank Herbert. <br/>
If no input file is provided it can also parse from stdin.<br/>
